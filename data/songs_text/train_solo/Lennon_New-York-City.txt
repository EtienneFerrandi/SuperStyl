Standing on the corner, just me and Yoko Ono We was waiting for Jerry to land Up come a man with a guitar in his hand Singing "have a marijuana if you can" His name was David Peel, we found that he was real He sang "The Pope Smokes Dope Everyday" Up come a police man shoved us up the street Singin, "Power to the People today!"  New York City...New York City...New York City Que pasa New York?...Que pasa New York? Hey hey  Well down to Max's City Put down the nitty gritty with the Elephants Memory Band Laid something down as the news spread around About the Plastic Ono Elephants Memory Band! We played some funky boogie and laid some "Tutti Frutti" Singing "Long Tall Sally's A man" Up come a preacher man trying to be a teacher Singing "God's a red herring in drag!"
