Well it was Sunday Bloody Sunday When they shot the people there The cries of thirteen martyrs Filled the free Derry air Is there any one amongst you Dare to blame it on the kids? Not a soldier boy was bleeding When they nailed the coffin lids!  Sunday bloody Sunday Bloody Sunday's the day!  You claim to be majority Well you know that it's a lie You're really a minority On this sweet Emerald Isle When Stormont bans our marchers They've got a lot to learn Internment is no answer It's those mothers' turn to burn!  Sunday bloody Sunday Bloody Sunday's the day!  Sunday bloody Sunday Bloody Sunday's the day!  You Anglo pigs and Scotties Sent to colonise the north You wave your bloody Union Jacks And you know what it's worth! How dare you hold to ransom A people proud and free Keep Ireland for the Irish Put the English back to sea!  Sunday bloody Sunday Bloody Sunday's the day!  Sunday bloody Sunday Bloody Sunday's the day!  Well it's always bloody Sunday In the concentration camps Keep Falls and roads free forever From the bloody English hands Repatriate to Britain All of you who call it home Leave Ireland to the Irish Not for London or for Rome!  Sunday bloody Sunday Bloody Sunday's the day! Sunday bloody Sunday Bloody Sunday's the day! Sunday bloody Sunday Bloody Sunday's the day! Sunday bloody Sunday Bloody Sunday's the day! Sunday bloody Sunday Bloody Sunday's the day! Sunday bloody Sunday Bloody Sunday's the day! Sunday bloody Sunday Bloody Sunday's the day!
