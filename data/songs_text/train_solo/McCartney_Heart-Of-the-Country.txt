I look high, I look low, I'm lookin' ev'rywhere I go, Lookin' for a home in the heart of the country.  I'm gonna move, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna tell ev'ryone I know, Lookin' for a home in the heart of the country.  Heart of the country where the holy people grow, Heart of the country, smell the grass in the meadow, Wo, wo, wo.  Want a horse, I want a sheep, I wanna get me a good night's sleep, Livin' in a home in the heart of the country.  I'm gonna move, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna tell ev'ryone I know, Livin' in a home in the heart of the country.  Heart of the country where the holy people grow, Heart of the country, smell the grass in the meadow, Wo, wo, wo.  Want a horse, I got a sheep, I'm gonna get me a good night's sleep, Livin' in a home in the heart of the country.  I'm gonna move, I'm gonna go, Gonna tell ev'ryone I know, oo-oo-oo In the heart of the country.  Heart of the country where the holy people grow, Heart of the country, smell the grass in the meadow, Wo, wo, wo.
